      <!-- Thesis -->
      <p id="projecttitle"> Honors thesis: "Interactive Visualization of Douglas Fir Forest Growth Using 3-PG" </p>
      <p id="projectdesc"> My project combines a complex numerical simulation with a user interface and 3D graphics to create an interactive 
        forest visualization. I created a new implementation of the existing and well-trusted forest growth model 3-PG in C/C++ and added graphics 
        with OpenGL and a user interface using GLUT. While 3-PG has been added to in many ways over the years since its creation in 1997 (by Dr. Landsberg and 
        Dr. Waring), there has never been a 3-D visualization for it, and very little in the way of a user interface (most implemtations are in Excel, with a 
        few in R and a new one in FORTRAN). Basically, you can control and change various input parameters to the simulation and see how they affect the forest
        in real time. The idea behind this was to add a new layer of discovery and interactivity to the model. I worked with my mentor Dr. Mike Bailey on this project from the spring of 2022 until this May.</p>

      <!-- Capstone -->
      <p id="projecttitle"> Capstone senior group project: Rigid body dynamics driving simulation in Bevy using Rust</p>
      <p id="projectdesc"> The idea behind this project was to create an engineering simulation using a game engine to see how well this would work for simulation creators
        (as opposed to making their own simulations from scratch). We used the game engine Bevy (which is Open Source and Rust based) to create a driving simulation with rigid body 
        dynamics algorithms. My focus in the project was on the physics and how to simulate the different parts of the car. I learned a lot from this project about simulating a complex machine.
        This project also gave me the chance to become more familiar with Rust. 
       </p>
       <p id="project-skills">Skills: Rust, Bevy game engine, physics (RBDA), creating a simulation, team work and communication.</p>

      <!-- Forest builder -->
      <p id="projecttitle"> Forest builder </p>
      <p id="projectdesc"> Programmed a basic forest creation program in OpenGL. Allows user to place randomly generated
        trees on a plane, then view those trees from an overhead view or a walk-through view. The tree models are some of the first models I ever made in Blender, which is why they
        look... interesting. This was a class project for CS450 (Intro to Computer Graphics).</p>
        <p id="project-skills">Skills: C/C++, OpenGL, creating a simple user interface. </p>

      <!-- Moss shader -->
      <p id="projecttitle"> Moss shader </p>
      <p id="projectdesc"> AKA the Mossifier. Programmed a moss shader using GLSL and OpenGL. Esentially, it puts a moss-like texture onto any OBJ file loaded into the program.
        There are a few options to the moss shader, inlcuding a few moss patterns generated using noise. The background textures have normal mapping.
        This was a class project for CS457 (Computer Graphics Shaders). </p>
        <p id="project-skills">Skills: Creating shaders with GLSL, working with noise, OpenGL. </p>

      <p id="projectdesc"> This one is a little goofy, but I made this entire animation in Blender, including creating all the models. This was a class project for CS499: Computer Animation. </p>
      <p id="project-skills">Skills: Blender, 3D modelling, creating an animation with keyframes. </p>
